# Pneumonia-Image-Classification
# Diagnosis of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images using Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview

The aim of this study is to accurately classify chest x-ray images as pneumonic or normal(without pneumonia). The classification/prediction outputs of the model from this study will be an alternative pneumonia diagnostic tool or can be used parallel to other commonly used diagnostic tools. Since medical/veterinary professionals are considered to be end-users, the accuracy of this classification will help to compare with other conventional diagnostic tools.

In this project, a chest x-ray image from Kaggle was used to predict whether the picture has pneumonia or not.  The advancement of science coupled with the medical errors in healthcare facilities has created the necessity to improve disease diagnostic tools. Artificial Intelligence(AI), known for its efficiency and accuracy, has been used in medical diagnosis. Pneumonia being one of the leading fatal diseases globally, it is imperative to use advanced AI-based diagnostics to save lives. A Simple perceptron and Convolutional neural network (CNN)models were used to deploy the image classification. The highest accuracy score among the models was used to interpret the exact prediction(image classification).


## Data Overview

This data comes from a Kaggle. A total of 5,863 Chest X-Ray images of pneumonic and normal were used.

## Methodology

A Simple perceptron and Convolutional neural network (CNN)models were used to deploy the image classification. The highest accuracy score among the models was used to interpret the exact prediction(image classification). Normalization and reshaping of the image were done on each train, test, and validation dataset. Dropout techniques were used for regularization too. The accuracy score was evaluated and the highest score was selected.

## Project Results

The Convolutional neural network (CNN) model has the highest accuracy score.

## Conclusion
I recommend that radiologists and medical/veterinary professionals consider using AI-based image classification of x-ray images as an alternative and accurate tool for pneumonia diagnosis.

I recommend that radiologists and other concerned physicians and veterinarians use image classification for pneumonia diagnosis. 
I also recommend further study should be conducted to compare other pneumonia diagnostic tests image classification.  Regular model evaluation and updating the image classification tools to achieve the highest accuracy score are recommended.


Next Steps
The image classification model should be revised and evaluated based on diverse clinical features of pneumonia.
